This survey consists of 3 blocks, previous one did not consist of different blocks. Using different blocks for different categories of questions is useful to make the survey better organized which might increase the comfort of respondents and the reliability of the results.\nAssignment 2\nLooking at the google trends data for 5 years for the keywords Trump, Biden and Elections; we see that Trump is almost always the most searched one, and that the second most is Biden. However, during election time, election becomes the most searched one. After Trump lost the last election, we see that his popularity decreased but during the last year, it is in an increase.\nR codes for the same dataset:\nlibrary(gtrendsR)\na&lt;-gtrends(c(“trump”,“biden”,“elections”))\nb&lt;-a$interest_over_time\nI think using the R package is more useful because you can have all the data more easily."
