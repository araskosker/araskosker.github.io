Belove there is my CV.\n\nMy answers for Assignment 1\nThe final version of the survey: https://utdallas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1B5tbWVp9fwXisK\n2.a) The survey consists of one element of instructive introduction and 17 short questions.\n2.b) The first element is a kind instruction about the survey.

Then, 5 demographic quesions are asked at the end.\n7. Questions can be optimized for mobile.\nFurther assignment\nlink to survey: https://utdallas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dpqFtpMk7vEHIY6\n4. This survey consists of 3 blocks, previous one did not consist of different blocks. Using different blocks for different categories of questions is useful to make the survey better organized which might increase the comfort of respondents and the reliability of the results.\nAssignment 2\nLooking at the google trends data for 5 years for the keywords Trump, Biden and Elections; we see that Trump is almost always the most searched one, and that the second most is Biden. However, during election time, election becomes the most searched one. After Trump lost the last election, we see that his popularity decreased but during the last year, it is in an increase.\nR codes for the same dataset:\nlibrary(gtrendsR)\na&lt;-gtrends(c(“trump”,“biden”,“elections”))\nb&lt;-a$interest_over_time\nI think using the R package is more useful because you can have all the data more easily.\nAssignment 3\nWhen we look at the plots, we see that Trump used the word “American” more than Biden and Obama respectively. We also see that Obama used the word “people” more than Trump and Biden.\n“Wordfish is a Poisson scaling model of one-dimensional document positions (Slapin and Proksch 2008). Wordfish also allows for scaling documents, but in comparison to Wordscores, reference scores/texts are not required. Wordfish is an unsupervised one-dimensional text scaling method, meaning that it estimates the positions of documents solely based on the observed word frequencies.” (source: https://tutorials.quanteda.io/machine-learning/wordfish)\nAssignment 5\nI had an error and could not fix that.\nAssignment 6\nWhen we run the code we obtain the following plots:\n\n\nTo download multiple pdf/data files, we can can use the libraries in pyhton such as “requests”, “BeautifulSoup”or “lxml”.\nAssignment 7\nFrom the government website I downloaded data on the Budget of The United States Government for the fiscal year 2024. I planned the data management based on the time taken to process the data.\nArrow, Feather and Parquet are columnar storage formats used for data storage. Arrow is an in-memory data structure. Feather is a binary columnar data format and it uses Arrow as its memory. Parquet is useful in case of nested data structures.\nAssignment 8\nAfter running the first code, we can compare the median age in the US states for 2010 and 2019 with the following plots:\n\n\nWe see that in the central states such as North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma median age has decreased.\nRunning the second code, we obtain the income levels for Texas and Dallas for 2010 and 2020 respectively.\nFor 2010:\n\n\n\nFor 2020;"
